# xcode-template-creator

A simple python script to create an Xcode template. Either give it a base project directory to copy, or tell it to alter an existing plist file inside of a template directory. You can edit [Base.plist](https://github.com/Will-Scheirey/xcode-template-creator/blob/main/Base.plist) if you want any default settings to be changed.

The script assumes that all groups are contained within folders and that folders represent groups
